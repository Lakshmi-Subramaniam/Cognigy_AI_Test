# Get Started with Cognigy.AI

Welcome to Cognigy.AI! This guide will walk you through creating your first Virtual Agent (VA) and deploying it for public use. Let's begin your journey into the world of Conversational AI.

## 1. Create Your Virtual Agent

A Virtual Agent is an automated bot designed to handle interactions. Here's how to create one:

1. Click **Create Agent** in the top-left corner.
2. In the "Create Agent" wizard:
   - Name your VA (e.g., "My New Agent")
   - Select the primary language
   - Choose a color for easy navigation
   - Select the **Blank template**
   - Confirm **Webchat** as the output channel
   - Skip the **Skills** section for now
3. Click **Go to Agent** to start building.

## 2. Design Your First Conversation Flow

A Flow defines the logic and sequence of a conversation. Let's create a simple one:

1. Navigate to **Build > Flows** in the left sidebar.
2. Click **New Flow** and name it (e.g., "Flow 1").
3. In the Flow editor, add a **Say Node** between the Start and End nodes:
   - Click the plus icon
   - Select **Say Node**
   - In the Text field, enter a greeting (e.g., "Hello User!")
   - Save the node

## 3. Test Your Virtual Agent

Use the Interaction Panel to chat with your VA:

1. Click the speech bubble icon in the top-right to open the Interaction Panel.
2. Type "hello!" and press Enter.
3. You should see your VA's response.

> **Tip:** Use the "more options" menu (three dots) or press Ctrl + B to clear the chat.

## 4. Enhance Your VA with a Question

Let's make your VA interactive by asking a question:

1. Add a **Question Node** after your Say Node.
2. Set the Type to "Text" and enter a question (e.g., "What's your name?").
3. Add another **Say Node** after the Question Node.
4. In the new Say Node, enter "Hello " followed by the Last Question Result token.

Test your enhanced VA in the Interaction Panel to see it in action!

## 5. Deploy Your Virtual Agent

Make your VA publicly accessible:

1. Go to **Deploy > Endpoints** in the sidebar.
2. Click **New Endpoint**.
3. Name your endpoint (e.g., "Web") and select "Webchat" as the Endpoint Type.
4. Choose your main Flow (e.g., "Flow 1").
5. Save and click "Open Webchat" to see your VA in a browser.

Congratulations! You've created and deployed your first Virtual Agent with Cognigy.AI.
